            The 2020-21 academic year marks the start of Oberoi International School’s 13th year of operation, and what a journey it has been to this point! The school opened its doors in August 2008 to an original, founding cohort of 38 students and by August 2020, the number of students enrolled at OIS had grown to over 2550 students from Nursery to Grade 12.
              
              <br>
              
              From a first graduating class of just 15 students in 2011, 108 members of the Class of 2020 proudly received their diplomas in May.

              <br>
Another watershed development marked the opening of the 2017-18 academic year: Our second campus opened (to students in Nursery – Grade 4) on the Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Linking Road (or JVLR), just a couple of kilometres south of the original OGC campus.
              
              <br><br>
              We have had to adjust our nomenclature to distinguish between our two campuses, so we now refer to the original campus in Goregaon East as our “Goregaon Campus/OGC Campus.”, reflecting its location within the Oberoi Garden City development and the new campus is now referred to as our “JVLR Campus,” reflecting its location on this main east-west artery.
<br>
With OIS now comprising two campuses, the inevitable questions get asked: Will each campus serve different grade levels or different student populations? Will each campus run different programs? Will the two campuses operate independently of each other or will they be connected in some way?
<br>
As you explore our site further, you will see that we have adopted a “One School Two Campuses” model. 
              <br><br>
              All of our teachers are OIS teachers, and all of our students and their families are OIS families. The school (with its two campuses) operates under the strategic direction of the Oberoi Foundation Board of Trustees. 
              
              <br><br>
              The school (with its two campuses) employs the same guiding statements and philosophy, policies, procedures, fee structure, etc. We are committed to providing all OIS students the same high quality, IB education, no matter which campus they attend.
              
              <br><br>

In addition, both campuses are now 3-programme, IB Continuum Schools running the Primary Years (Nursery - G5), Middle Years (G6 - 10), and Diploma (G11 & 12) programme. 
              
              <br><br>
              This creates fantastic opportunities for a collaborative approach to educating the 2,600 students that make up the OIS student body.
              
              <br><br>

              We look forward to another successful year of teaching or learning! </p>

Our technology vision of “ Explore, Engage, Empower ” aligns with our school’s vision of giving our students the Freedom to think and Empower to be…

   <br><br>           
At OIS we believe that implementing technology in the classroom helps develop the skills that will be crucial to societal progress in the future. Through technology use at OIS students will be future ready to work in teams. 
              <br><br>Our students are resilient and have a healthy curiosity developed through global communication with peers and all this prepares each of them for the world of tomorrow by equipping them with 21st Century skills. <br><br>

Student agency and use of technology plays a key role in creating a positive tech-ecosystem that imbibes strong values of digital citizenship.<br><br> It creates a safe learning environment giving chance to constructive and visual reflections on learning, imagination, curiosity and the synthesis of knowledge gained from all quarters of the school. <br><br>Opportunities are created for self-directed learning, as well as improving skills and understanding through technology. <br><br>We have a growing community of learners across both campuses and our vision and mission ensures that we move forward with strong synergy, collaborative leadership and shared best practices. <br><br>

OIS is well resourced in terms of technology and the infrastructure to support newer technologies by ensuring:

All teachers are equipped with MacBooks to facilitate teaching and learning. <br><br>
OIS runs a BYOD program for students in Grades 4/5 -12, where all our students use Apple devices. <br><br>
Primary students have access to shared iPads and MacBooks to enhance their learning experiences. <br><br>
Platforms like Seesaw, ManageBac, and Open Apply facilitate student learning, reflection, and parent-school communication. <br><br>
OIS has its own home developed Mobile App to keep parents updated.<br><br>
All classrooms are equipped with either regular or interactive projectors and Apple TVs. <br><br>
High-capacity servers are used for data storage
Apple Server Managers in both campuses support class content app pushing and manage devices. <br><br>
Seamless high speed wi-fi internet access is available for students throughout both campuses, which is fully integrated with the latest Firewall technology to prevent unauthorised access and content filtering. <br><br>
IT support teams are in place at each campus, and they work closely with the educational technology staff in the Primary and Secondary divisions at both campuses. <br><br>

Welcome to the Oberoi International School (OIS) and our diverse learning community from around the world! <br><br>
As you navigate through our website, you will get to know us, our mission and the character of our school and see how we prepare our young people for a fulfilling life of personal success and academic excellence. <br><br>

At OIS, we recognise that to prepare students for our increasingly complex and interconnected world, we must provide them with new ways of thinking and new ways of collaborating in solving our most pressing global issues. <br><br>

As such, our mission goes far beyond preparing students for good universities and prosperous careers; we want to create globally-minded and critical-thinking innovators ready to re-shape the world for the better. <br><br>Through the curriculum of the International Baccalaureate (IB), we develop the whole human being. <br><br>A confident young person courageous in their willingness to question what they observe around them.<br><br> A student able to take complex and often disparate knowledge, concepts and skills and forge these into new and unique ways of solving problems and adding value to their world.<br><br>

We make learning relevant and exciting for students, as we continually draw connections between what they learn in the classroom and the real world. <br><br>Perhaps most importantly, we encourage our young people to reflect on their learning - and to act on it in the service of others. <br><br> We believe that learning should inform action and create impact. <br><br>

We are proud of our inclusive entry policy, which means students of all abilities are welcomed here.<br><br> Our academic results consistently place us among the top international schools in the world, while our sport, music, drama and other activities are all of the highest quality. <br><br>

This is a wonderful time to be at OIS. <br><br> We hope you will come visit us, spend some time at the school and experience first hand the unique, vibrant and wonderfully inclusive community. <br><br>

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about OIS. <br><br>

We hope to see you on campus in the near future. <br><br>
